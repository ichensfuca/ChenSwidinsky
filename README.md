**carayol mod 2.txt**: for the proof of Theorem 1.3, we check that there is no homomorphism from a problematic group to a subgroup of order 24 or 48 in the codomain of \varphi

**chebotarev bounds.txt**: confirms Table 1, Proposition 5.1, and the constants in Theorem 1.3, 1.5, 1.7

**deviation groups.txt**: confirms that none of the 1208 possible 2-adic images for E/Q can have a quotient isomorphic to one of the problematic groups of order 192, 128, or 64

**genus less than 2.txt**: confirms the count of 1208 possible 2-adic images that occur for infinitely many elliptic curves E/Q

**gl2data.txt**: Rouse-Zureick-Brown data on possible arithmetically maximal 2-adic images of elliptic curves E/Q

**gl2finedata.txt**: Rouse-Zureick-Brown data on possible arithmetically maximal 2-adic images of elliptic curves E/Q which do not contain -I

**possible orders.txt**: lists the possible orders of the deviation group \delta(G) in (5.13)

**problematic groups.txt**: confirms the list of problematic groups in Table 2

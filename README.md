carayol_mod_2.m: for the proof of Theorem 1.3, we check that there is no homomorphism from a problematic group to a subgroup of order 24 or 48 in the codomain of \varphi

chebotarev_bounds.m: confirms Table 1, Proposition 5.1, and the constants in Theorem 1.3, 1.5, 1.7

deviation_groups.m: confirms that none of the 1208 possible 2-adic images for E/Q can have a quotient isomorphic to one of the problematic groups of order 192, 128, or 64

genus_less_than_2.m: confirms the count of 1208 possible 2-adic images that occur for infinitely many elliptic curves E/Q

gl2data.txt: Rouse-Zureick-Brown data on possible arithmetically maximal 2-adic images of elliptic curves E/Q

possible_orders.m: lists the possible orders of the deviation group \delta(G) in (5.13)

problematic_groups.m: confirms the list of problematic groups in Table 2

Each program file has a corresponding .out file which contains the transcript of the run (the version of Magma used can be found in this file).
